## Solution description

This is a solution to the problem2 (CP#4).


## Instructions

This solution has a python file ‘prob2_gen.py’ that will read the input file from the input-dir and generated the blog file needed to solve the problem.

This solution still has a problem but the blog code generated is correct. We are trying to resolve this issue.

To run: ./run.sh param-file input-dir output-dir

## Assumption
1. The format of the input files are the same as ‘problem-3-outputs.csv’ given in the problem set

##Output

The output of this problem still has a bug. Sorry.

## Parameter files

A parameter file contains number of samples run by blog.

`solution-smoketest` runs with less number of samples. Run about a few seconds with the given input file.
`solution-evaluation` runs with more number of samples.
