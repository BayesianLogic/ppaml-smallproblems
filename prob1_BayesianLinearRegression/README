## Solution description

This is a solution to the small problem1 (CP#4).


## Instructions

This solution has a python file ‘prob1_gen.py’ that will read the input file and generated the blog file needed to solve the problem.

‘prob1.blog’ specify all the distributions for the model for this problem.

To run: ./run.sh param-file input-dir output-dir

## Assumption
1.The parameter of all the distributions is assumed to be the one stated in the detailed problem description
2. The format of the input file is the same as ‘problem-1-data.csv’ given in the problem set

##Output
Look inside the output directory, ‘prob1_out’ , this specify the posterior distribution of w.

## Parameter files

A parameter file contains number of samples run by blog.

`solution-smoketest` runs with less number of samples. Run about 75 seconds with the given input file.
`solution-evaluation` runs with more number of samples.
